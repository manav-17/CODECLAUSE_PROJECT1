# CODECLAUSE_PROJECT1
Project Title - Fraud Detection

Aim - Detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset.

Description- Apply anomaly detection or classification algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent activities.

Technologies-

a.Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It is used here to read the CSV file and manipulate the dataset.

b.NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python. It is often used in conjunction with Pandas for array operations and numerical calculations.

c.Scikit-learn (sklearn): A widely used library for machine learning in Python. Several components from scikit-learn are used in your code:

1.Isolation Forest: An anomaly detection algorithm used to identify outliers in the dataset.

2.train_test_split: A function used to split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3.StandardScaler: A method used to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

4.classification_report, accuracy_score, confusion_matrix: Functions used for evaluating the performance of the model.

d.Machine Learning: The entire process of training and evaluating a model on a dataset is a fundamental concept in machine learning. Here, you are using the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in a credit card transaction dataset.

e.Data Preprocessing: The code involves preprocessing steps, such as scaling the features using StandardScaler and splitting the data into training and test sets.

f.Model Evaluation Metrics: The use of classification metrics (like classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy score) to assess the performance of the model is part of the evaluation phase in machine learning.
